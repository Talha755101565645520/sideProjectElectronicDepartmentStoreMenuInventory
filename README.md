# Important Details about this Side Project **electronic_department_store_menu_inventory.py**:
This program displays a menu and asks the user that is the customer to make a selection from an inventory of items that he or she wants to 
purchase from an Electronics Department Store. A while loop repeats the program until the user selects item 5 from the menu. Input Validation is also
used in this program to make sure that users do not accidentally or intentionally enter the wrong input such as a letter character, symbol character,
or negative numbers or floating point data types. This program can help people, especially those with disabilities, when purchasing menu items in a 
department store.
